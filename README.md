# QUMaps

This was my semester long project for my Mobile Programming class (CSC 430).
It functions as a google maps, but for my college campus's main building.
It was originally run using Android Studio. These are just the code files.

The way it works is the user chooses their start and stop locations from a drop down list.
If the start and stop locations are on different floors or the same floor but different sides of the building, it takes the user to the elevator and then away from the elevator into the room.
If they are on the same floor and same sides, it takes into account if you are going away from or towards the elevator and figures out the directions that way.
